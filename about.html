          Hi, I’m Alexis Lewis—a digital media professional with a passion for
          clean design, thoughtful storytelling, and creating online experiences
          that feel both functional and human.
        </p>
        <p class="handwritten-text">
          I graduated in May 2025 with a Bachelor of Applied Science in
          Digital Media, specializing in Web Development. During school, I
          completed an internship where I focused primarily on web maintenance
          and SEO. While the role didn’t offer many creative opportunities, it
          taught me how to work within real-world constraints, prioritize user
          needs, and maintain strong digital foundations—skills I now carry into
          every project.
        </p>
        <p class="handwritten-text">
          I’m especially drawn to building websites that feel unique and
          original—outside the box, but still guided by industry best practices.
          I enjoy designing with purpose and personality, steering clear of
          cookie-cutter templates in favor of thoughtful, engaging digital
          spaces that stand out.
        </p>
        <p class="handwritten-text">
          Outside of work, I’m a proud animal lover (especially dogs!) and bring
          that same loyalty, energy, and curiosity into everything I do.
        </p>
        <p class="handwritten-text">
